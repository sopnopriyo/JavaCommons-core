/**
 * Direct 1-to-1 replacement to apache FileUtils. With one major "catch",
 *
 * All documentations here is copied from apache commons, trimmed down where necessary.
 * All deprecated functions are removed, to break things.
 *
 * And: There are no IOExceptions, they are all reduced to RuntimeException.
 *
 * Blasphamy!
 *
 * Note: This is suppose to be tagged to the latest apache.commons.io implementation, however as we (picoded)
 *       will only make the updated changes, when we actually finally need that updated function.
 *       Any changes to sync the libraries to latest with pull requests is welcomed =)
 *
 * @See https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/javadocs/api-2.5/org/apache/commons/io/FileUtil.html
